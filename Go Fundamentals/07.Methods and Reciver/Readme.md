In Go, methods are functions with a special receiver argument. They allow you to define behavior (functions) that is associated with a typeâ€”this brings Go closer to object-oriented programming without actual classes.

#### Methods

Methods are functions that are associated and belong to a type.
We can defile methods for both custom or derived types.

``` 
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age int
}

func(p Person) getDetails() string {
return fmt.Printf("Name: %s, Age: %d",p.Name,p.Age)
}
```
Here in the above code function *getDetails* is associated to Person type which makes it a method.

**There is no concept like method overloading in Go.**

```
type Rect struct{
    Length float64
    Width float64
}

func(r Rect) Area() float64{
    return r.Length * r.Width
}

func main(){

rectangle:=Rect{Length:5.0, Width:2.0}

fmt.Println(rectangle.Area())

}

```

In the above program Rect type have a function Area linked to it which returns the area of the Rect type associated to it. In the main function we decalre a type rectangle with a definite length and width and we used the Area method to print the are that is 10.0

**Like functions methods also recive copy of the associated type so we have to use the pointer of that type**

```

func(r *Rect) Area() float64{
    return r.Length * r.Width
}
```
